        A coffee bean is a seed from the Coffea plant and the source for coffee.
        It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit. This fruit is often
        referred to as a coffee cherry, and like the cherry, it is a fruit with
        a pit.
        <br /><br />
        Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are
        referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The
        fruits most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together.
        <br /><br />
        A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, called a
        "peaberry". Peaberries make up only around 10% to 15% of all coffee
        beans. It is a fairly common belief that they have more flavour than
        normal coffee beans.Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee
        beans consist mostly of endosperm.

          <p>
            A macchiato is an espresso-based coffee drink marked with a small
            amount of steamed milk or milk foam. It maintains the bold flavor of
            espresso with a subtle hint of creaminess. The name "macchiato"
            means "stained" or "spotted" in Italian.

            Cold brew is a coffee made by steeping coarsely ground beans in cold
            water for 12-24 hours. It has a smooth, less acidic taste and is
            served chilled, often over ice.

          <h4>French Press</h4>
          <p>
            Cold French press is a method of making cold brew coffee using a
            French press by steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold water for
            12-24 hours. It yields a smooth, rich flavor and is filtered by
            pressing down the plunger before serving.
